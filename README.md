The following papers are the papers that fits my PhD research interest. They are mainly tackling the real-time reconstruction of multiplle dynamic objects or non-rigid objects. Some papers are off-line work yet also very interesting.

Due to my personal interests, SFM-based or factorization-based work are not collected here. Those papers can be found [here](https://github.com/openMVG/awesome_3DReconstruction_list).

Another related paper list is about the semantic segmentation, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mrgloom/awesome-semantic-segmentation).
